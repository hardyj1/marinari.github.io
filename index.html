<a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h3>

<p>I am currently taking classes at Seattle University to become a certified web developer. I am self-motivated and I genuinely view coding as an opportunity to harness my skills, not as a chore. I started classes at Seattle University on the web development track in January. Before that, I did an extensive search looking for the perfect "coding school". I have attended numerous orientations for bootcamps. I feel proud and grateful that I found the Seattle U program. The robust curriculum builds a strong foundation for students to excel as web developers. It is not only about learning web technologies and learning how to code. It is about learning these skills in context of how it impacts consumers.</p>

<h3>
<a id="skills" class="anchor" href="#skills" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Skills</h3>

<p>The past jobs I've held have been primarily in administration and retail. Skills from these industries do not directly translate to the skills needed for a web developer. However, I still gained useful skills and experience from those jobs.
+Over 3 years of customer service. I am comfortable talking to people in a pleasant, professional manner. I am comfortable resolving conflicts with customers.
+Teamwork. I have experience working in small teams and coordinating with people in order to create an efficient and transparent work environment.
+Organization. At my current job I have to manage various orders, filing, and tasks for a group of people. This forces me to be organized, things have to be ordered on time without gaps in supplies and my workspace has to be clear so other people can easily navigate it.
+Avid, Passionate learner. I am a patient student and I see obstacles as an opportunity to learn. Working on class projects and practicing programming on my own is exciting to me.
+Good Communication Skills: Active Listener. I make a conscious effort to fulling listen to information before responding. This allows me to understand the complete message that is communicated. 
          Technical Skills
            +Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign
            +Photography
            +HTML5, CSS3
            +Version Control: Git, Github
            +Social Media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr</p>

<a id="social-impact" class="anchor" href="#social-impact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Social Impact</h3>

<p>I am passionate about programming and about breaking the mold of what a traditional developer is. The <a href="https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/you-may-have-seen-my-face-on-bart-8b9561003e0f#.ldahherqm">#ILookLikeanEngineer</a> hashtag was launched to challenge common misconceptions about who engineers are. The hashtag grew in popularity as women and people of color used it to share their experiences in an industry that is traditionally run by mostly white and Asian men. These types of social movements personally resonate with me and I look forward to redefining the parameters of what a programmer/ web developer can look like.</p>
