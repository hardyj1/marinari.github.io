          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>I am currently taking classes at Seattle University to become a certified web developer. I am self-motivated and I genuinely view coding as an opportunity to harness my skills, not as a chore. I started classes at Seattle University on the web development track in January. Before that, I did an extensive search looking for the perfect "coding school". I have attended numerous orientations for bootcamps. I feel proud and grateful that I found the Seattle U program. The robust curriculum builds a strong foundation for students to excel as web developers. It is not only about learning web technologies and learning how to code. It is about learning these skills in context of how it impacts consumers. Detailed course desctiption including links to the Seattle University Website are in the "Education" section.<p>

        <h2>Social Impact</h2>
        <p>I noticed immediately that your firm has a diverse work environment. I am passionate about programming and about breaking the mold of what a traditional developer is. The <a href="https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/you-may-have-seen-my-face-on-bart-8b9561003e0f#.ldahherqm">#ILookLikeanEngineer</a> hashtag was launched to challenge common misconceptions about who engineers are. The hashtag grew in popularity as women and people of color used it to share their experiences in an industry that is traditonally run by mostly white and Asian men. These types of social movements personally resonate with me and I look forward to redefining the parameters of what a programmer/ web developer an look like. I believe this passion aligns with Efelle's progressive work culture values.</p>
